## Codex Agent - Initial Setup

**Date:** 2025-07-29

### Summary
- Established base folder structure with `src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `notebooks`, and GitHub workflow directory.
- Created Python package stubs with docstrings and an executable `src/main.py`.
- Implemented a minimal WebSocket slot streamer in `src/solana/data.py`.
- Generated `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, and `.gitignore`.
- Initialized Rust crate under `src/rustcore/` for future performance modules.
- Added first unit test for the slot streamer constructor.

### Design Decisions
- **Python 3.10** target specified in `pyproject.toml` for modern syntax.
- WebSocket dependencies kept minimal (`websockets` library) for now.
- Rust crate left as default to allow future expansion in performance-critical paths.
- Simple CI workflow (`agent_push.yml`) to run linting and tests on push.

### Next Steps
- Flesh out orchestration logic in `main.py` and connect to risk and inference modules.
- Expand Rust core with basic event parsing utilities.
- Implement more comprehensive tests and logging.

## Codex Agent - Posterior Stub and Risk Manager

**Date:** 2025-07-29

### Summary
- Added `PosteriorEngine` and `RiskManager` stubs under `src/solbot/engine`.
- Enhanced `SlotStreamer` with reconnect logic for robustness.
- Created new unit test `test_engine.py` for posterior output shape.
- Extended README with component details and test instructions.

### Design Decisions
- PosteriorEngine currently returns softmax probabilities based on dummy coefficients; serves as placeholder for future Bayesian model.
- RiskManager tracks simple equity and drawdown for use by later utility modules.
- SlotStreamer reconnects on any websocket error to prevent stalls during network issues.

### Next Steps
- Integrate PosteriorEngine predictions into main orchestration loop.
- Expand Rust core for on-chain data parsing.
- Implement CLI configuration management.

## Codex Agent - Config and Licensing Update

**Date:** 2025-07-29

### Summary
- Introduced proprietary licensing via `LICENSE` file and updated package metadata.
- Added command line configuration utilities with `BotConfig` dataclass.
- Expanded `PosteriorEngine` with an online `update` method.
- Enhanced `RiskManager` with position tracking helpers.
- Updated `main.py` to parse CLI args and wire together streaming, inference, and risk modules.
- Added tests for configuration and risk logic (now 5 tests).
- Documented configuration and license sections in README.

### Design Decisions
- License marked as **Proprietary** and package.json set to `UNLICENSED` to keep distribution controlled.
- `parse_args` accepts optional argument list for testability.
- Orchestration remains simple placeholder but demonstrates how modules interact.

### Next Steps
- Flesh out real on-chain parsers in Rust core.
- Implement persistence and advanced inference logic.

## Codex Agent - Blockchain License Verification

**Date:** 2025-07-29

### Summary
- Added `LicenseManager` in `src/solbot/utils/license.py` to check for a license
  SPL token and distribute it from an authority wallet.
- Extended configuration with a `--wallet` option so the running user provides
  their wallet address.
- Updated `main.py` to verify the wallet owns a license token before starting.
- Documented the process in README under a new "License Verification" section.
- Exposed license helpers in `solbot.utils.__init__` and updated tests and
  dependencies.

### Design Decisions
- License token is represented by an SPL token mint on Solana. Presence of this
  token in a wallet enables full functionality. The specific mint and authority
  addresses are placeholders (`LICENSE_MINT`, `LICENSE_AUTHORITY`) to be filled
  by maintainers.
- Verification uses `solana-py` client via HTTP RPC to fetch token accounts by
  owner. Distribution performs a simple token transfer using the authority
  keypair.

### Next Steps
- Replace placeholder mint and authority addresses with real ones and secure key
  management for the distributor.
- Extend unit tests to mock RPC responses and cover the license check logic.

## Codex Agent - Advanced License Management

**Date:** 2025-07-29

### Summary
- Introduced demo licensing via a second SPL mint (`DEMO_MINT`).
- `LicenseManager` now detects full/demo licenses, creates token accounts on
  distribution, and exports `verify_or_exit` for enforcement.
- Environment variables allow runtime configuration of `LICENSE_MINT`,
  `DEMO_MINT`, and `LICENSE_AUTHORITY`.
- `main.py` calls `verify_or_exit` and warns when running in demo mode.
- Updated README with detailed setup instructions and environment variable usage.
- Extended utils exports to include `DEMO_MINT`.

### Design Decisions
- Demo mode lets users observe output without trading, lowering the barrier to
  trial while keeping full functionality gated by an on-chain token.
- License distribution creates associated token accounts when necessary to avoid
  manual setup for new users.

### Next Steps
- Implement secure storage for the authority keypair when distributing licenses.
- Add tests covering the new demo checks and `verify_or_exit` logic.

## Codex Agent - Secure Keypair Storage

**Date:** 2025-07-30

### Summary
- Added encrypted keypair loading via `LICENSE_KEYPAIR_PATH` and
  `LICENSE_KEYPAIR_KEY` environment variables.
- `load_authority_keypair` decrypts the keypair with Fernet.
- `LicenseManager.distribute_license` now loads the keypair automatically when
  none is provided.
- Updated utils exports and README with instructions on secure keypair storage.
- Added a unit test for keypair loading.

### Design Decisions
- `cryptography` dependency introduced for symmetric encryption. The encrypted
  keypair prevents accidental leakage of the authority secret key.

### Next Steps
- Extend CLI tooling for automated license distribution.

## Codex Agent - License CLI Expansion

**Date:** 2025-07-30

### Summary
- Added `solbot.tools.distribute_license` module providing a command line utility to send license tokens
- Extended `LicenseManager` with helpers `token_accounts`, `token_balance`, `license_balance` and `fetch_license_account`
- Updated README with instructions for the new distributor and environment variable usage

### Design Decisions
- CLI arguments mirror environment variables so the authority wallet path and decryption key can be provided at runtime
- Balance queries aggregate across all token accounts to support multiple wallets holding licenses

### Next Steps
- Implement caching of RPC responses to reduce network load during frequent checks

## Codex Agent - Python Compatibility

**Date:** 2025-07-31

### Summary
- Updated configuration and license modules to avoid the Python 3.10 ``|`` union
  syntax so the project can run on Python 3.9.
- Adjusted the license distribution CLI accordingly.

### Design Decisions
- Introduced ``typing.Optional`` imports and replaced union type hints with
  ``Optional`` generics where applicable.

### Next Steps
- Clarify the minimum supported Python version in the documentation.

## Codex Agent - License Issuer Service

**Date:** 2025-07-31

### Summary
- Added `license_issuer` FastAPI service with an authenticated `/issue` endpoint.
- Service uses `LicenseManager.distribute_license` and loads the encrypted keypair
  for each request to avoid persistent secrets.
- Exported the service app via `solbot.utils` and updated README with usage
  instructions.
- Implemented in-memory zeroisation when loading the authority keypair.
- Added tests for the new service and updated dependencies to include FastAPI
  and Uvicorn.

### Design Decisions
- Authentication is via a bearer token specified in the `LICENSE_API_TOKEN`
  environment variable. Empty token disables auth for local testing.
- Keypair decryption uses byte arrays so decrypted bytes can be wiped from
  memory immediately after use.

### Next Steps
- Integrate the service into CI and containerize it for deployment.

## Codex Agent - License Service Documentation

**Date:** 2025-07-31

### Summary
