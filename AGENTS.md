# Agent Log

## Codex Agent - Initial Setup

**Date:** 2025-07-29

### Summary
- Established base folder structure with `src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `notebooks`, and GitHub workflow directory.
- Created Python package stubs with docstrings and an executable `src/main.py`.
- Implemented a minimal WebSocket slot streamer in `src/solana/data.py`.
- Generated `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, and `.gitignore`.
- Initialized Rust crate under `src/rustcore/` for future performance modules.
- Added first unit test for the slot streamer constructor.

### Design Decisions
- **Python 3.10** target specified in `pyproject.toml` for modern syntax.
- WebSocket dependencies kept minimal (`websockets` library) for now.
- Rust crate left as default to allow future expansion in performance-critical paths.
- Simple CI workflow (`agent_push.yml`) to run linting and tests on push.

### Next Steps
- Flesh out orchestration logic in `main.py` and connect to risk and inference modules.
- Expand Rust core with basic event parsing utilities.
- Implement more comprehensive tests and logging.

## Codex Agent - Posterior Stub and Risk Manager

**Date:** 2025-07-29

### Summary
- Added `PosteriorEngine` and `RiskManager` stubs under `src/solbot/engine`.
- Enhanced `SlotStreamer` with reconnect logic for robustness.
- Created new unit test `test_engine.py` for posterior output shape.
- Extended README with component details and test instructions.

### Design Decisions
- PosteriorEngine currently returns softmax probabilities based on dummy coefficients; serves as placeholder for future Bayesian model.
- RiskManager tracks simple equity and drawdown for use by later utility modules.
- SlotStreamer reconnects on any websocket error to prevent stalls during network issues.

### Next Steps
- Integrate PosteriorEngine predictions into main orchestration loop.
- Expand Rust core for on-chain data parsing.
- Implement CLI configuration management.

## Codex Agent - Config and Licensing Update

**Date:** 2025-07-29

### Summary
- Introduced proprietary licensing via `LICENSE` file and updated package metadata.
- Added command line configuration utilities with `BotConfig` dataclass.
- Expanded `PosteriorEngine` with an online `update` method.
- Enhanced `RiskManager` with position tracking helpers.
- Updated `main.py` to parse CLI args and wire together streaming, inference, and risk modules.
- Added tests for configuration and risk logic (now 5 tests).
- Documented configuration and license sections in README.

### Design Decisions
- License marked as **Proprietary** and package.json set to `UNLICENSED` to keep distribution controlled.
- `parse_args` accepts optional argument list for testability.
- Orchestration remains simple placeholder but demonstrates how modules interact.

### Next Steps
- Flesh out real on-chain parsers in Rust core.
- Implement persistence and advanced inference logic.

## Codex Agent - Blockchain License Verification

**Date:** 2025-07-29

### Summary
- Added `LicenseManager` in `src/solbot/utils/license.py` to check for a license
  SPL token and distribute it from an authority wallet.
- Extended configuration with a `--wallet` option so the running user provides
  their wallet address.
- Updated `main.py` to verify the wallet owns a license token before starting.
- Documented the process in README under a new "License Verification" section.
- Exposed license helpers in `solbot.utils.__init__` and updated tests and
  dependencies.

### Design Decisions
- License token is represented by an SPL token mint on Solana. Presence of this
  token in a wallet enables full functionality. The specific mint and authority
  addresses are placeholders (`LICENSE_MINT`, `LICENSE_AUTHORITY`) to be filled
  by maintainers.
- Verification uses `solana-py` client via HTTP RPC to fetch token accounts by
  owner. Distribution performs a simple token transfer using the authority
  keypair.

### Next Steps
- Replace placeholder mint and authority addresses with real ones and secure key
  management for the distributor.
- Extend unit tests to mock RPC responses and cover the license check logic.
