# AGENTS AUDIT

This file defines the immediate and near-term directives for the next development agent. The items are ordered by criticality and expected impact. Implement each item completely before moving to the next.

## User Vision & Dashboard Overhaul Backlog (2025-08-09)

The following directives capture a comprehensive UX and functionality review from the project owner. Treat every bullet as a blocking issue. Remove placeholder data and wire all modules to real-time backend or hide them. Default everything to Solana-centric metrics with live SOL→USD conversions.

### 1. Initial State & Global Layout
- **Default mode:** Demo with 10 SOL starting balance; show equivalent USD (no `+10 SOL` prefix).
  - Modify `web/public/dashboard.html` around the settings form to seed `demoCapital` with `10` and immediately render `10 SOL ($<spot USD>)`.
  - Fetch SOL price from `/market/solusd` on load and cache for conversions.
- **Engine toggle:** Dashboard loads in `paused` state. User presses `START` to begin. `PAUSE` always stops trading.
  - In `web/public/dashboard.html` (lines ~100, ~1935), set `running=false` on init and ensure the button text reads `▶ START`.
  - Backend (`src/server.py`) must not auto-start trading loops when `--wallet` is provided; require explicit `/state` POST.
- **Top bar:** Only display `LIVE`/`DEMO` mode, RPC latency, and hamburger for side menu. Move clock into settings. Remove “WS DISCONNECTED”.
  - Delete the `#wsStatus` span in `dashboard.html` and relocate the clock element into the settings panel header.
  - Add `id="rpcLatency"` span fed by `/health` and `id="modeIndicator"` derived from `/state`.
- **Responsive design:** Only “Portfolio Value” and “Realized P&L” may sit side‑by‑side on large screens. All other modules stack vertically and scale cleanly across mobile → 4 K. Test both portrait and landscape.
  - Refactor `dashboard.css` to use a single-column flex layout below 1280 px and explicit `md:grid-cols-2` only for the top metrics.
  - Verify layout manually in Chrome dev tools for iPhone SE, iPad, and 4 K monitor presets.
- **Side menu:** Add a left‑side hamburger button revealing navigation links. Sections: Dashboard, Whale Tracker, Strategies (includes AI Backtesting Lab), MEV Shield & Alpha Signals, Social Sentiment Matrix, Settings. Menu must slide in/out smoothly and be obvious on all viewports.
  - Implement `#sideMenu` off‑canvas panel in `dashboard.html` with Tailwind `translate-x` transitions and overlay.
  - Each link should route via `window.location` to `dashboard.html`, `whales.html`, `strategies.html`, `mev.html`, `sentiment.html`, and `settings.html` respectively.
  - Ensure hamburger button (`#menuToggle`) remains accessible at <768 px.

### 2. Top Metrics Panel
- **Realized P&L card:** Format `+0.00 SOL ($0.00)` and a second line `+0.00 SOL TODAY ($0.00)`.
  - Replace placeholder spans `#realizedPnl` and `#realizedPnlToday` with data from `GET /pnl/realized`.
  - Convert SOL→USD using cached price and update every 5 s.
- **Portfolio Value card:** Align the equity curve to draw left→right; if a % change line is shown, label it clearly.
  - Use `/chart/portfolio?limit=50` to draw sparkline via `Chart.js`.
  - Overlay `% Δ` line in muted colour with legend “Change”.
- **Open Positions mini‑map:** Replace static counters with a scalable left→right visual of each open trade. Must handle dozens of trades; consider horizontal scroll or mini‑cards.
  - Render `div#openPositionMap` with child cards from `/positions` and `/positions/ws`.
  - Each card shows token, size, PnL, and auto-removes when closed. Enable horizontal scroll with Tailwind `overflow-x-auto`.

### 3. Module Ordering & Removal
- Remove **Backtest P&L** and **System Status** from main dashboard. Surface uptime/resource usage within Settings instead.
  - Delete sections `#backtestPnl` and `#systemStatus` from `dashboard.html` (lines ~700 and ~900).
  - In `settings.html`, create `#resourceUsage` card showing CPU, RAM, and uptime fetched from `/metrics`.
- Module order after the top metrics:
  1. Realized P&L
  2. Open Positions
  3. Portfolio Equity Curve / P&L Breakdown / Market Data / Regime Analysis (tabbed)
  4. Portfolio & Positions
  5. Portfolio Risk
  6. (Navigation to other pages: Whale Tracker, Neural Strategy Matrix & other AI integrations, Strategies/Backtesting, MEV Shield & Alpha Signals, Social Sentiment Matrix)

### 4. Equity Curve / P&L / Market Data / Regime Analysis Tabs
- **Tab styling:** The active tab text is normal; inactive tabs are highlighted. Clicking a tab loads its content and removes highlight from current tab.
  - Use `aria-selected` attributes on buttons `#equityTab`, `#pnlTab`, `#marketDataTab`, `#regimeTab` to drive Tailwind classes.
- **Equity Curve:** Replace “Data Unavailable” with live equity history. Handle empty history gracefully.
  - Fetch `/chart/portfolio?limit=500` and plot via `Chart.js` line chart; show “No trades yet” if array empty.
- **P&L Breakdown:** Replace static bar chart and pie chart. Bar chart shows real daily P&L for last 14 days. Pie chart includes at least five strategies (`Sniping`, `Arbitrage`, `Market Making`, plus two additional categories) so the donut fills space.
  - Endpoints: `GET /pnl/daily?days=14` and `GET /strategy/breakdown`.
  - Render bar chart with `Chart.js` and donut with categories `Sniping`, `Arbitrage`, `Market Making`, `Liquidity`, `Other`.
- **Market Data:** Feed live metrics for any token pair surfaced by the engine, not just major pairs. Include new coin launches and trending tokens with volume/liquidity/volatility/spread.
  - Poll `/market/active` every 10 s; each row links to `/chart/{symbol}` for full TradingView embed.
  - Include columns for `24hVolume`, `volatility`, `liquidity`, `spread`.
- **Regime Analysis:** Populate with posterior outputs when available; otherwise show clear “No data yet”.
  - Consume `/posterior` stream via WebSocket; show regime probabilities and rug probability.

### 5. Missing/Static Modules
- **Neural Strategy Matrix:** Replace “DATA UNAVAILABLE” with real model status or hide if model not yet running.
  - Endpoint `/neural/status` returns `{ syncing: bool, latency_ms: int }`; display sync status or hide card if 404.
- **Arbitrage Quantum:** Validate metrics (`TRADES`, `PNL`, `SPREAD`, `OPPORTUNITIES`, `LATENCY`); remove if zero.
  - Hook up to `/arbitrage` polling; highlight card only when `opportunities>0`.
- **Strategy Performance & Risk Analytics:** Fetch `/strategy/performance`, `/strategy/breakdown`, `/strategy/risk`. Remove extra vertical space above the metrics.
  - Ensure `7D/30D` toggle triggers new requests with `?window=7d|30d` and charts update.
- **MEV Shield & Alpha Signals:** Numbers must come from backend. Include rug‑protection integration once available.
  - Consume `/mev/status` and `/alpha/signals`; show “inactive” greyed-out if response empty.
- **Social Sentiment Matrix:** Monitor memecoins and all Solana tokens. Pull data from Twitter/Telegram. “Trending Now”, “Influencer Alerts”, and community metrics must update live.
  - Integrate `/sentiment/trending`, `/sentiment/influencers`, `/sentiment/pulse` and show counts/mentions with emoji indicators.
- **Strategy Performance Matrix:** Replace static SOL totals with real data. Ensure 7D/30D toggles work and reduce padding between heading and stats.
  - Endpoint `/strategy/performance_matrix?window=7d|30d`; collapse extra margin-top to `mt-2`.
- **Whale Tracker:** Implement real‑time whale flow, copy‑trading stats, and profit tracking.
  - Create `web/public/whales.html`; feed from `/whales` REST and `/whales/ws` for live events.

### 6. Backtesting & Strategy Pages
- **AI Backtesting Lab:**
  - Allow custom date ranges via actual date pickers.
  - Replace Sniper/ARB/MM sliders with clearer allocation inputs (e.g., numeric fields or segmented controls).
  - Explain each parameter.
  - Simulation results must reflect backend output (final balance, return, trades, Monte Carlo).
  - Integrate trading parameters (max drawdown, position size, concurrent trades).
  - Provide cancel button and history list that do not shift off‑screen when running.
- **Backtest WS bug:** Current websocket opens/closes repeatedly and blocks terminal on exit. Diagnose cause, allow proper shutdown, and return CLI control without killing terminal.
  - Frontend: `strategies.html` or backtesting panel must POST to `/backtest` and subscribe to `/backtest/ws/{id}` streaming progress.
  - Implement date pickers with `<input type="date">` for start/end; default to last 7 days.
  - Replace strategy sliders with numeric `%` inputs totaling 100; validate client-side.
  - Simulation result table (`#backtestResults`) should map directly from JSON fields `final_balance`, `total_return`, `total_trades`, `win_rate`, `avg_trade`, and Monte Carlo stats.
  - Pull max drawdown/position/concurrent limits from settings form via `localStorage` and include in backtest payload.
  - Keep `Start`, `Cancel`, and `History` buttons fixed with Flexbox so layout does not jump when labels change.
  - Backend: investigate `src/backtest/worker.py` and websocket lifetime; ensure server terminates coroutine on cancel and closes process so terminal prompt returns.

### 7. Settings Panel
- **Default ordering:**  
  1. System time/time‑zone selector  
  2. System health summary  
  3. Configuration (mode, starting capital)  
  4. Trading parameters  
  5. Backtesting controls  
  6. Strategy modules toggles  
  7. Module status  
  8. Network config  
  9. API connection (always last)
- **Mode & capital:** Demo mode selected by default with `SOL` primary asset. Provide dropdown of ~15 top “stable” Solana tokens plus an `Other…` search by name/$symbol/contract address. Remove “Supported Assets” label.
- **Trading parameters:**
  - Max drawdown slider 0–100%; when >25% show warning dialog.  
  - Max position size switchable between % and SOL; upper limit “max” with no numeric cap.  
  - Max concurrent trades default “Unlimited”. When enabled, use stepped logarithmic slider: `0–10`, `10–25`, `25–100`, `100–250`, `250–500`, `500+`.
- **Strategy modules:** `Listing Sniper` on and highlighted by default. Ensure toggles for `Arbitrage Engine` and `Market Making` actually enable/disable code paths.
- **Network config:** Selecting “Custom Endpoint” should reveal text box for RPC URL.
- **Backtest controls:** Remove ellipsis from “Running…”. Keep buttons fixed width so “Cancel” and “History” stay visible.
  - File: `web/public/settings.html` and linked JS.
  - Time zone selector should prefill from browser `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` and POST to `/state`.
  - System health summary pulls from `/health` (uptime, cpu_pct, mem_pct) and displays in `#systemHealth` card.
  - Configuration: demo/live toggle stored in `localStorage`; starting capital input enforces numeric >0.
  - Mode dropdown: populate with fixed list [`SOL`, `USDC`, `USDT`, `BONK`, ...] plus search field hitting `/market/search?q=`.
  - Trading parameter sliders implemented with `<input type="range">` and labelled values; warning dialog as `alert()` or modal when drawdown >25%.
  - Strategy toggles invoke `/strategy/enable` or `/strategy/disable` endpoints; ensure visual highlight via Tailwind `bg-blade-amber`.
  - Network config: when `Custom Endpoint` selected, show text input `#customRpc` and persist to `localStorage`.
  - Backtest controls: `#backtestStart`, `#backtestCancel`, `#backtestHistory` widths fixed with `w-24`.

### 8. AI Feature Panels & Debug Console
- **AI Feature Schema / Feature Snapshot / Feature Monitor:** Currently redundant and empty. Either populate with meaningful descriptions & live values or remove entirely. If retained, document feature indices and normalisation.
- **Debug Console:** Add a “Generate” button to pull logs on demand. Respect filter (`All`, `Errors`, etc.). Ensure console shows live backend messages.
  - If kept, document feature names in `docs/ai_features.md` and map indices to descriptions in `web/public/dashboard.html` table rows `#featureSchema`, `#featureSnapshot`, `#featureMonitor`.
  - Backend should expose `/features/schema` and `/features/snapshot` endpoints; front-end polls every 10 s.
  - Debug console (`#debugConsole`) fetches `/debug/logs?level=all|error|warn` when `#generateLogs` button pressed and appends lines; auto-scroll when near bottom.

### 9. Engine Behaviour & Performance
- On server start (CLI launch), engine immediately begins ingesting all Solana chain data, including newly launched memecoins. Monitor entire blockchain, not just known markets.
- Implement robust rug‑pull detection and ensure MEV protection is first‑class.
- The ML component must learn continually from incoming data, persist state, and resume learning after restarts. Aim for strategies with positive ROI out‑of‑the‑box while remaining customizable.
- Default strategies (`Sniper`, `Arbitrage`, `Market Making`) must ingest full memecoin universe, apply volume/liquidity/tx-count filters (dexscreener-style), and deliver safe entries/exits.
- Persist model parameters to `~/.solbot/ml_state.pkl`; reload on startup and update after each trade.
- Implement rug-protection heuristics (liquidity pull, mint authority revoke, sudden supply mint) and surface alerts to MEV Shield and Risk modules.
- Address high CPU (≈200%) and 1.2 GB memory usage; profile and optimise.
  - Data ingestion: verify `src/solbot/slot_streamer.py` listens to all token launches via Solana websocket `logsSubscribe` with filters for new mints.
  - Persist ML state to `~/.solbot/state.db` using `pickle` or sqlite; reload on start before processing live events.
  - Implement rug-detect heuristics (liquidity pull, mint authority revoke) in `src/solbot/risk/rug.py` and surface alerts to MEV Shield panel.
  - Profile with `py-spy` or `cProfile`; log CPU/mem metrics to `/metrics` and add thresholds for warnings.
  - Diagnose RPC latency stuck at 12 ms and websocket status reporting `DISCONNECTED`; ensure health endpoints expose real measurements.

### 10. Miscellaneous UI/UX
- Rename branding to **“SOL SEEKER”** (with space). Review fonts and adopt a modern, non‑retro typeface.
- Add footer with GitHub repo link, “© IJR Enterprises Inc.”, and reference to a disclaimer document.
- Provide first‑run walkthrough for **Basic Mode** users. Basic Mode exposes only core strategy selection; Advanced Mode (toggle in settings) reveals full configuration.
- Start/Stop controls: center `START`/`STOP` buttons; place settings icon left of compact `LIVE`/`DEMO` toggle at top-right.
  - Replace `Share Tech Mono`/`Rajdhani` fonts with `Inter` (Google Fonts) in `dashboard.html` head section.
  - Footer HTML fragment placed at bottom of every page; include links to repo and `docs/DISCLAIMER.md`.
  - Implement onboarding modal `#firstRun` that describes Basic vs Advanced, persists `localStorage['onboarded']=true` after dismissal.

Treat this backlog as non‑optional. Each item must be either fully implemented or explicitly removed before release.

## Line-Level TODO Map (2025-08-09)

The following pointers map exact file locations requiring attention. Line numbers are 1-indexed and refer to the current commit; adjust if the surrounding code changes.

### `web/public/dashboard.html`
- **L6:** `<title>` still reads "Sol Seeker Dashboard". Rename to `SOL SEEKER Dashboard`.
- **L23–26:** Tailwind font config uses `Share Tech Mono` and `Rajdhani`; swap to `Inter` once CSS is updated.
- **L78–82:** Header `<h1>` shows `SOLSEEKER DASHBOARD`; needs spacing and branding update.
- **L87–110:** Connection status includes RPC + WS blocks. Remove entire WS block (L98–109) so only RPC latency remains.
- **L112–120:** Trading toggle should initialize in paused state; ensure text reads `▶ START` until engine starts.
- **L132:** `#systemTime` clock belongs in settings panel; delete from header and re-render within settings.
- **L145–158:** Portfolio Value card outputs only USD. Must call `/chart/portfolio?limit=50` and display both SOL and USD with sparkline aligned left→right.
- **L161–174:** Realized P&L card is placeholder. Replace with `/pnl/realized` values: `+0.00 SOL ($0.00)` and `+0.00 SOL TODAY ($0.00)`.
- **L177–186:** Open Positions card shows counts only. Render horizontal mini-cards from `/positions` (scrollable if >4). Remove `0 LONG • 0 SHORT` text once visual map exists.
- **L189–199:** System Status card to be removed; uptime and status will live in settings (`#resourceUsage`).
- **L203–210:** Backtest P&L card to be deleted from dashboard; backtesting moves entirely to settings/strategies page.
- **L217–300:** Portfolio & Positions module—verify tabs switch and tables populate from `/positions` and `/orders`. Empty states should clearly show "No data".
- **L301–470:** Equity Curve / P&L Breakdown / Market Data / Regime Analysis tabs. Ensure active tab is unhighlighted and others highlighted. Fetch data per AGENTS-AUDIT §4.
- **L471–620:** Portfolio & Positions full module. Left table lists open positions (live updates), right shows history with pagination.
- **L621–690:** Portfolio Risk card; hook to `/risk/portfolio`. Each metric (drawdown, leverage, exposure) must reflect real backend data.
- **L700–790:** Whale Tracker placeholder—implement separate `whales.html` or dynamic panel fed by `/whales` and `/whales/ws`.
- **L807–831:** Neural Strategy Matrix header and container. Replace "DATA UNAVAILABLE" with model sync status (`/neural/status`) or hide if endpoint missing.
- **L833–865:** Arbitrage Quantum card. Metrics (`arbTrades`, `arbPnL`, `arbSpread`, `arbOpps`, `arbLatency`) must poll `/arbitrage`. Remove card when `opportunities=0`.
- **L867–877:** Strategy Performance panel: buttons `7D`/`30D` switch; results populate from `/strategy/performance?window=`.
- **L879–883:** Strategy Breakdown panel: render from `/strategy/breakdown` with at least five categories.
- **L885–891:** Risk Analytics panel: fill via `/strategy/risk` and reduce top margin to `mt-2`.
- **L892–951:** MEV Shield & Alpha Signals section: numbers must derive from `/mev/status` and `/alpha/signals`; show inactive state if empty.
- **L963–1045:** Social Sentiment Matrix: integrate `/sentiment/trending`, `/sentiment/influencers`, `/sentiment/pulse`; ensure memecoin coverage.
- **L1046–1103:** Strategy Performance Matrix: replace static SOL totals with `/strategy/performance_matrix` data and shrink spacing above metrics.
- **L1104–1178:** Strategy Breakdown/Performance tables: ensure toggles function and remove stale demo numbers.
- **L1179–1214:** AI Backtesting Lab shell: add date pickers (`<input type="date">`), numeric allocation inputs, and explanation tooltips.
- **L1215–1268:** Backtest configuration/results inside the lab: respect trading parameters, keep buttons fixed width, and prevent layout shift.
- **L1669–1765:** Backtest simulation modal and controls. Provide Cancel/History behaviour without pushing buttons off-screen and show progress updates.
- **L2491–2570:** `runBacktest` and related JS handlers: support custom ranges, include drawdown/position size/concurrency in payload, and resolve websocket hang on shutdown.

### `web/public/dashboard.css`
- **L1:** Add comment about replacing fonts with `Inter`.
- **L5–7:** Enforce responsive single-column layout below 1280 px; only top metrics remain side-by-side on large screens.
- **L40–77:** Existing `hologram-panel` and animation definitions remain but ensure they don't cause high CPU usage.
- **L121–150:** `.metric-card` hover effects; verify accessibility for colour contrast.
- **L197–214:** `.tooltip` styles; confirm they are keyboard-focus accessible.

### `web/public/whales.html`
- Placeholder stub for Whale Tracker; implement live table and copy-trading stats per §5.

### `web/public/strategies.html`
- Stub for strategy catalog and AI Backtesting Lab; wire to `/backtest` and strategy endpoints per §6.

### `web/public/mev.html`
- Stub for MEV Shield & Alpha Signals dashboard; fetch `/mev/status` and `/alpha/signals`.

### `web/public/sentiment.html`
- Stub for Social Sentiment Matrix; integrate `/sentiment/trending`, `/sentiment/influencers`, `/sentiment/pulse`.

### `web/public/settings.html`
- Stub for standalone settings page; order sections and controls per §7.

### Server Side
- **`src/server.py` L1–100:** Prevent auto-start of trading loops when CLI `--wallet` is supplied; require POST `/state` to start.
- **`src/backtest/worker.py` L50–120:** Investigate websocket open/close loop causing terminal lock; ensure tasks are awaited and connections closed on shutdown.

### Settings Panel (embedded in `dashboard.html` around L1500–1800)
- Default ordering: time/time‑zone selector, system health, configuration, trading parameters, backtest, strategy toggles, module status, network config, API connection.
- Demo mode selected by default with starting capital `10` SOL and dropdown of top 15 tokens plus `Other…` search hitting `/market/search`.
- Max drawdown slider 0–100% with warning when >25%.
- Max position size: toggle between % and SOL with `max` option.
- Max concurrent trades: logarithmic stepped slider (`0–10`, `10–25`, `25–100`, `100–250`, `250–500`, `500+`).
- Strategy toggles for `Listing Sniper`, `Arbitrage Engine`, `Market Making` must call `/strategy/enable|disable` and visibly highlight when active.
- Network config: selecting `Custom Endpoint` reveals text input `#customRpc` persisted to `localStorage`.
- Backtest controls: `#backtestStart`, `#backtestCancel`, `#backtestHistory` fixed width (`w-24`); remove ellipsis from "Running".
- Time zone selector pre-fills from browser and posts to `/state`.

### Miscellaneous
- Footer to include GitHub link and © IJR Enterprises Inc. with disclaimer reference once `docs/DISCLAIMER.md` exists.
- Replace fonts (`Share Tech Mono`, `Rajdhani`) with `Inter` across HTML/CSS.
- Ensure ML component persists state to `~/.solbot/state.db` and resumes learning on restart.

## Recent Accomplishment – Analytics Expansion and Security Panel Wiring (2025-08-07)

### Summary
- Introduced `StrategyStat` and `ArbitrageStat` models with `/strategies` and `/arbitrage` endpoints returning deterministic demo metrics and registering both routes in the service map.
- Added sentiment and news analytics via `/sentiment/trending`, `/sentiment/influencers`, `/sentiment/pulse`, and `/news`, each backed by Pydantic models and advertised for dashboard discovery.
- Exposed security flag elements (`#rugPull`, `#liquidity`, `#contractVerified`, `#holderDistribution`, `#tradingPatterns`) in the dashboard and updated the renderer to fetch `/risk/security`, renaming the prior market liquidity stat to avoid ID collisions.
- Expanded server tests to cover all new analytics routes and assert service-map exposure; added a Jest unit test verifying the WebSocket reconnect ceiling halts retries.

## Recent Accomplishment – Backtest Endpoint and Dashboard Enhancements (2025-08-07)

### Summary
- Added a configurable backtesting pipeline (`BacktestConfig`, `run_backtest`) and exposed a `/backtest` API route.
- Wired the dashboard with a backtest form, metrics card, auto-saving settings with toast errors, endpoint-specific WebSocket reconnects, and DOM-diffed position rendering.

### Next Agent Objectives
1. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Implement unit and integration tests for `run_backtest`, `/backtest`, and front-end helpers. Set up Jest so `npm test` executes.
   - Add error-path tests for autosave and WebSocket reconnection logic.
   <!-- Progress: Extended `tests/test_server.py` to cover `/risk/security`, `/whales`, `/smart-money-flow`, `/strategies`, `/arbitrage`, `/sentiment/trending`, `/sentiment/influencers`, `/sentiment/pulse`, and `/news` endpoints while asserting service-map entries. Added Jest `ws_reconnect.test.ts` to confirm reconnect ceiling behavior. Autosave and reconnect error-path tests remain todo. -->
2. **Backtest UX & Persistence**
   - Persist API credentials and backtest parameters in local storage with validation and clear error messages.
   - Stream backtest progress and support cancellation for long jobs; handle and surface backend errors.
   <!-- Completed: Dashboard validates API base URL and key, restores both along with last backtest params from `localStorage`, and refuses submission until client-side schema checks pass. Missing CSV sources now raise HTTP 404 for clarity. Streaming/cancellation still pending. -->
3. **Resilience & Performance**
   - Enforce reconnect attempt limits with user notifications when an endpoint remains unreachable.
   - Profile DOM diffing and reconnection code under heavy update rates; document bottlenecks and propose optimizations.
   <!-- Completed: WebSocket manager tracks per-endpoint reconnect counts, logs attempts, and emits a toast after exceeding the ceiling before halting retries; Jest tests `ws_reconnect.test.ts` and `ws_reconnect_error.test.ts` cover success and failure paths. Added `perf_profile.test.ts` and `docs/dashboard_performance.md` profiling DOM diffing and reconnection loops with optimization notes. -->

## Recent Accomplishment – Demo Mode Toggle and Equity Chart (2025-08-09)

### Summary
- Enabled switching between live and demo trading modes with persistent paper assets and capital via `/state`.
- Blocked order placement in demo mode and reset risk state when toggling to paper trading.
- Implemented `/chart/portfolio` backed by `RiskManager.equity_history` and added websocket-driven `/backtest/ws/{id}` progress stream.
- Expanded tests to cover state transitions, portfolio chart, and backtest progress.

### Next Agent Objectives
- Replace simulated backtest data with real strategy execution and support cancellation.
<!-- Completed: `/backtest` now executes a momentum strategy over CSV data and yields for cancellation; tests verify real PnL and job aborts. -->
- Surface equity history limits and add pagination or downsampling for long sessions.
<!-- Completed: `/chart/portfolio` now enforces `offset`/`limit` with server-side downsampling and the dashboard pages through history while tests guard limit and pagination paths. -->

## Dashboard-API Connectivity Gaps
The static HTML dashboard in `web/public/dashboard.html` still presents demo data. Every element below must either consume a real
endpoint or be removed. Wire items **in place** rather than creating new components so future agents can diff easily. Always
inject the stored API key and `sol_seeker_api_base` when issuing requests. After implementing each sub‑task, verify with the
browser network panel or `curl` that the request returns 2xx and the DOM updates accordingly.

### 1. Core Controls & Status

1. **Trading toggle – `#tradingToggle` (lines ~100 & ~1989)**
   - **Endpoint:** `POST /state` with `{ running: boolean }`.
   - **UI:** Text and style swap between `▶ START` and `⏸ PAUSE`.
   - **Verification:** After POST, `GET /state` and confirm `running` matches. Update tooltip to show last transition time.
   <!-- Agent Notes (2025-08-09): Implemented trading toggle button wired to `/state`. Verifies state via `GET /state` and updates
   tooltip with last change timestamp. -->

2. **Emergency stop – `.emergency-stop` (lines ~115 & ~2519)**
   - **Endpoint:** `POST /state` with `{ running: false, emergency_stop: true }`.
   - **UI:** Button flashes red, then shows `✓ STOPPED` for 3 s. Trading toggle reset to `▶ START`.
   - **Verification:** `GET /positions` must return `{}`; new `/state` reads `running=false`.
   <!-- Agent Notes (2025-08-09): Emergency stop posts `{ running:false, emergency_stop:true }`, verifies positions cleared and
   temporarily shows ✓ STOPPED before restoring button. -->

3. **RPC latency indicator – add `id="rpcLatency"` to latency span (line ~89)**
   - **Endpoint:** `GET /health` every 5 s; use `health.rpc_latency_ms`.
   - **UI:** Replace hard-coded `12ms`; tooltip shows last sample timestamp.
   - **Verification:** Introduce console log on each poll; inspect network to ensure requests stop on tab visibility change.
   <!-- Completed: Poller now runs at 5 s intervals when tab visible, writes `rpc_latency_ms` into `#rpcLatency`, and logs each sample via `console.log('RPC latency sample:', latency)` for ops troubleshooting. -->

4. **WebSocket heartbeat – add `id="wsStatus"` (line ~96)**
   - **Endpoint:** `/dashboard/ws` heartbeat messages already contain `timestamp`.
   - **UI:** When no message for >10 s, show red dot and “DISCONNECTED”; on reconnect, restore cyan dot.
   - **Verification:** Throttle network to offline in DevTools and confirm indicator flips after timeout.

5. **System status & uptime – `#systemStatus`, `#systemUptime` (lines ~129–139)**
   - **Endpoint:** `GET /status` on load and every 30 s.
   - **UI:** Replace static “OK” and “99.97%” with `status.state` and `status.uptime_pct`.
   - **Verification:** Manually alter backend to return non‑OK and ensure card turns amber with tooltip `status.detail`.

### 2. Portfolio Metrics

1. **Portfolio value / change – `#portfolioValue`, `#portfolioChange` (lines ~142–154)**
   - **Endpoint:** `GET /dashboard` and `/dashboard/ws` (fields `risk.equity` & `risk.realized`).
   - **UI:** Show `risk.equity` as dollars, compute day change using previous snapshot.
   - **Verification:** Run `curl /dashboard` twice with altered risk values and ensure live websocket updates reflect changes.

2. **Realized P&L – `#realizedPnL`, `#realizedPnLChange` (lines ~160–171)**
   - **Endpoint:** Same `/dashboard` payload (`risk.realized` & `risk.sharpe`).
   - **UI:** `realizedPnL` shows cumulative realized; `realizedPnLChange` displays intraday delta and arrows.
   - **Verification:** Execute a mock order via `POST /orders` and confirm realized P&L updates in <1 s through websocket.

3. **Open positions – `#openPositionsTotal`, `#openPositionsActive`, `#openPositionsBreakdown` (lines ~173–187)**
   - **Endpoint:** `GET /positions` on load; subscribe to `/positions/ws` for changes.

> After all modules are wired, run through the dashboard with network throttling and backend restarts to confirm graceful error
handling (spinners, toasts, reconnect loops) for every widget.

## 1. Core Data Ingestion and Feature Pipeline
1. Replace the placeholder slot-only stream with real on-chain event subscriptions.
   - Update `src/solbot/solana/data.py` to subscribe via WebSocket to program logs or account changes for DEX swaps, liquidity adds/removes, and token mint events.
   - Ensure reconnect and backoff logic handles high event rates without dropping messages.
   - **Notes:** Implemented `LogStreamer` in `src/solbot/solana/data.py` with WebSocket log subscriptions, internal buffering, and exponential backoff to avoid dropped messages. Deprecated `SlotStreamer` in favor of event-centric streaming.
   - [DONE] 2025-08-04 685f2799 — added Prometheus `log_queue_depth` gauge and `dropped_logs` counter with jittered backoff and fail-fast when queue >75% for 1s; `tests/test_data.py` asserts drop counter increments and stream halts.
   - **Notes:** Introduced `program_id` labels and public `reset_metrics` helper; `LogStreamer` now drains its queue on shutdown to avoid stale depth readings.
2. Implement real event parsing in Rust for low-latency processing.
   - Extend the Rust crate under `rustcore/` to decode swap instructions and liquidity events.
   - Expose parsers to Python via pyo3 and integrate them into `EventStream` so that each incoming log produces a populated `Event` object.
   - **Notes:** Added `ParsedEvent` struct and `parse_log` function in `rustcore/src/lib.rs` using `serde_json`; exposed via pyo3 and wired into `EventStream` for zero-copy conversion of logs to typed events.
3. Map parsed events to feature updates.
   - Use the existing `PyFeatureEngine` interface and ensure only touched indices are updated per event.
   - Implement update functors for at least: liquidity delta, cumulative liquidity, signed and absolute swap volume, swap inter-arrival time, and minted token amount.
   - **Notes:** `EventStream` now yields `solbot.schema.Event` objects derived from parsed logs, enabling `PyFeatureEngine` to update liquidity, volume, inter-arrival, and mint metrics with index-level precision.
4. Define the initial feature subset.
   - Use the taxonomy in `features.yaml` as the source of truth.
   - Document the index and normalization rule for every active feature.
   - **Notes:** Replaced `features.yaml` with six-feature schema mapping indices, categories, event sources, and z-score normalisation; documented the subset in README under an "Active Features" table.
5. Verify per-event processing cost stays O(k) where k is number of affected features.
   - Use profiling to confirm latency below 1 ms per event in Python and sub‑100 µs in Rust.
   - **Notes:** Added `tests/test_perf.py` benchmarking `parse_log` (<100 µs) and expanded `tests/test_features.py` latency benchmark for `PyFeatureEngine` (<80 µs) confirming O(k) updates.
6. Add persistent logging and basic storage.
   - Log every raw event and resulting feature vector at DEBUG level.
   - Implement a ring buffer or SQLite table to retain the latest N feature vectors for debugging and future backtesting.
   - **Notes:** `EventStream` now logs raw WebSocket logs and parsed events; `PyFeatureEngine` logs normalized features and maintains a deque history of the last N `(event, features)` tuples with `history()` accessor.
7. Ensure the pipeline handles thousands of events per second.
   - Use asyncio tasks or threads to parallelize network IO and parsing.
   - Stress test against devnet or mainnet traffic and document throughput.
   - **Notes:** `EventStream` decouples log reception and parsing via an `asyncio.Queue` and thread pool executor; `tests/test_data.py` streams 5k mocked logs in <2s verifying throughput.

## 2. Feature Vector Management
1. Finalise the `FeatureVector` class.
   - Confirm normalization uses an exponentially decaying Welford update with λ=0.995 and epsilon 1e-8.
   - Ensure lag stacking returns a contiguous 768‑float buffer: current slot, lag1, lag2.
2. Implement snapshot and reset utilities for stateful testing and backtesting.
3. Provide hooks for external modules to subscribe to feature updates.
   - Expose a thread-safe publish/subscribe interface that delivers feature vectors without blocking the ingestion loop.

## 3. Posterior Engine Integration
1. Replace dummy probabilities in `src/solbot/engine/posterior.py`.
   - Implement a logistic regression for rug probability and a three-class softmax for trend/revert/chop using the live feature vector.
   - Add an online gradient update method consuming feature vector and observed outcomes.
2. Prepare interfaces for future Bayesian models.
   - Keep `predict` and `update` signatures stable and document internal state for particle filters.
3. Connect posterior outputs to the feature pipeline.
   - Ensure predictions occur every slot with <1 ms overhead and can run concurrently with feature updates.

## 4. Action Selection and Trade Execution
1. Implement the utility-based action selector.
   - Inputs: posterior probabilities, current positions from `RiskManager`, estimated fees/slippage.
   - Output: {Skip, Enter(q), Exit(q)} with q sized via a preliminary Kelly fraction capped at 50%.
   - Enforce an epsilon threshold to avoid churn when utility improvements are negligible.
2. Tie the selector into the existing `TradeEngine`.
   - For now use paper trading mode; wire through to the risk manager and persistence layer.
3. Integrate a Solana execution path.
   - Begin with `simulateTransaction` for all actions.
   - After validation, enable real transaction submission respecting demo/full license state as returned by `LicenseManager.verify_or_exit`.
4. Log every decision.
   - Record inputs, chosen action, computed utilities, and resulting order IDs.

## 5. Safety and Demo Mode Enforcement
1. Guarantee that demo mode never submits on‑chain transactions.
2. Extend `RiskManager` with:
   - Per-position P&L tracking.
   - Global drawdown ceiling that halts new trades when breached.
3. Implement global stop conditions.
   - Network instability, excessive slippage, or schema mismatch should trigger an automatic safe mode (Skip only).
4. Add unit tests covering license enforcement, risk limits, and demo restrictions.

## 6. End-to-End Validation
1. Run full integration tests on devnet.
   - Confirm that parsed liquidity and swap events match on-chain state.
   - Verify feature vector updates and posterior predictions respond to real trades.
2. Capture and store a dataset of event→feature→prediction→action tuples for offline analysis.
3. Document benchmark results: ingestion latency, feature update time, posterior inference time, and action selection latency.

Completion of these steps establishes the continuous data backbone and decision loop required for live trading. Subsequent milestones (advanced inference, multi-market support, reinforcement learning, cross-chain expansion) depend on this foundation.

## 7. Advanced Inference and Online Learning
1. Replace the logistic/softmax stub with a hierarchical Bayesian model.
   - Maintain a particle set (>=128) for rug and regime parameters with Laplace priors.
   - Run stochastic variational Bayes every 4th slot on recent data batches.
2. Implement calibration and drift monitoring.
   - Track Brier scores and recalibrate probabilities via rolling beta scaling when miscalibration exceeds 5%.
   - Trigger model reset if cumulative prediction error doubles baseline.
3. Decouple inference from main loop.
   - Run updates in a dedicated thread or process and publish latest parameters atomically to trading loop.
   - Ensure prediction latency stays <1 ms despite background learning.

## 8. Feature Expansion and Multi-Market Coverage
1. Grow feature vector toward the full 256-d taxonomy.
   - Add Ownership (holder concentration, entropy, top-wallet balances) and Microstructure metrics (spread, realized vol, order-book imbalance).
   - Document each added feature’s index, units, and normalisation.
2. Monitor multiple token pairs concurrently.
   - Refactor ingestion and feature pipeline to handle a configurable list of pools with independent state vectors.
   - Share heavy resources (RPC websockets, Rust parsers) across markets while keeping per-market isolation.
3. Provide hot-plug support for new markets.
   - Allow dynamic registration of a token pair that spins up ingestion, feature tracking, posterior instance, and action selector on demand.

## 9. Position Sizing and Risk Controls
1. Implement Kelly criterion sizing with safety scalars.
   - Compute k* = μ/σ² per asset from posterior mean/variance and cap at γ=0.5.
   - Apply entropy dampening: scale position size by (1 - H(p)/log C) where H is regime entropy.
2. Upgrade `RiskManager` to portfolio-level metrics.
   - Track per-position P&L, exposure, and realized volatility.
   - Compute rolling 99% cVaR assuming multivariate normal copula and block new orders if limit exceeded.
3. Add drawdown watchdog.
   - Record equity peaks and automatically flatten positions when drawdown >10% or when any single trade would breach the limit.

## 10. Performance and Latency Optimisation
1. Profile ingestion, feature updates, inference, and action selection under load.
   - Target <500 µs ingestion, <250 µs feature update, <1 ms inference, <500 µs action selection.
2. Offload critical paths to Rust.
   - Move heavy feature transforms and utility calculations into `rustcore` modules exposed via pyo3.
3. Introduce caching and concurrency improvements.
   - Cache RPC responses for slot data and account info with TTL to cut network latency.
   - Use lock-free queues or asyncio to avoid cross-thread contention.
4. Implement resilience checks.
   - Detect and recover from feed stalls, parser panics, or RPC timeouts without full restart.

## 11. Testing, Backtesting, and Observability
1. Achieve >90% coverage for new modules with deterministic unit tests.
2. Build a replay harness.
   - Feed recorded event streams into the pipeline to validate feature updates and trading decisions offline.
3. Integrate property-based tests for parser correctness and risk invariants.
4. Instrument metrics and tracing.
   - Expose Prometheus counters for latency, trade outcomes, and risk breaches.
   - Add structured logs with correlation IDs for end-to-end tracing.
5. Automate CI.
   - Ensure linting, tests, and type checks run on every push; block merges on failure.

## 12. Long-Term Enhancements
1. Reinforcement learning policy updates.
   - Batch rewards and run policy-gradient updates with entropy bonus to adapt thresholds and sizing.
2. Multi-agent and distributed deployment.
   - Allow independent agents per market communicating via message bus while sharing risk state.
3. Cross-chain and CEX integration.
   - Abstract data/execution interfaces so additional chains or exchanges plug in with minimal changes.
4. On-chain automation.
   - Design Solana programs for pre-signed orders or stop-loss enforcement to reduce off-chain latency.
5. Continuous fraud detection expansion.
   - Add classifiers for new scam patterns and schedule periodic retraining on latest incidents.
